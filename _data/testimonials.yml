    <p>NL Healing has been a transformative haven for me. Nance's holistic
    approach and the supportive community guided me through life's transitions,
    helping me rediscover my strength and authenticity. It's a sanctuary I
    highly recommend to any woman seeking self-discovery and a nurturing
    community.</p>

    <p>Nance taught me how to choose my own directions, to listen to the voice
    of my heart and trusting my intuition. How important it is to set intentions
    and to celebrate every victory, even the small ones. She taught me how to
    recognize when I was in flow and she gave me the tools to bring myself back
    in flow when I feel stuck. I now have the tools to deal better with my
    anxiety and stress and take more time to do the things that spark joy for me
    because only then I create the space to let my creative energy flow and I
    can focus on the things that truly matter to me.&nbsp;</p><p>Thank you Nance
    for bringing myself back to me.</p>

    <p>The first Reiki session I ever had was with Nance. I had no idea what to
    expect but right away she clued into my energy and where I was “holding” it
    all. As the hour passed I could not only feel my energy level rising but a
    sense of relief and being held came over me. Nance truly has the “gift” and
    can tap into energy and help you focus on the areas that need release, she’s
    truly the real deal.</p>
