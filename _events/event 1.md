summary: |
  Each event is created to inspire people to “pause” to slow down and turn their attention inward and to come back to what truly matters to them. Each month I collaborate with other female healers each with their own unique gift so we can explore different tools for finding the way back to our hearts and back to each other.
  All the events are for women only. The Yin Yoga classes are for women and men. Each event is priced differently, please check the specific event you like to attend for the correct price.
details: Wear comfortable clothes and dress in layers, all yoga props are available at the studio.
