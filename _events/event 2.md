summary: |
  Do you like to start the 
  New-Year building a better connection with yourself and with other women but you don’t know how? 
  Then we like to invite you to “The Pause Collective” 
  to take a “pause” with us.
  This workshop for women is all about how to find that “pause” and how to reconnect with it over and over again. We would love for you to find your way back home, to reconnect with your true self, to honor your body and to rise together.
  During the workshop we connect through meditation, journaling, yoga and group connection where we will take a look at how we show up in our bodies and the world around us.
  I will collaborate with Jill Boeri, she is the founder of
  The Pause Collective, Jill is an amazing and loving human being and a therapist working with young women, I hold so much love for Jill.
  Please bring your yoga mat and wear comfy (yoga) clothes and layers.
