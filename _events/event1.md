summary: ' Yin Yoga is a slow-paced, introspective style of yoga that emphasizes holding poses for an extended period of time, usually between three to five minutes. This practice allows for a deep stretch and targets the connective tissues, such as ligaments, joints, and fascia, helping to improve flexibility and overall mobility. With roots in ancient Chinese Taoist philosophy, Yin Yoga aims to balance the body''s energy channels and promote relaxation, mindfulness, and inner harmony. Wear comfortable clothes and dress in layers.  The Yin yoga class is at Evergreen Wellness Studio, 1414 4th Street, San Rafael.'
