summary: >-
  Join me and Ellie Dominquez and Jodi McLean  for a morning of healing
  practices and community around grief. Grief comes in many different forms and
  is something we all deal with in our lives. The purpose this workshop is to
  start the conversation of how grief is unfolding in your life. I hope you will
  leave with a new in-person connection and a true sense that you are not alone
  and feel the supported you need. We will begin the morning with a light
  refreshments and mingling followed by an essential oil blend workshop to
  educate and create your own blend to support your current life journey. Then
  we will break and set up for a Yin Yoga class, Yin Yoga is a slower and
  meditating form of yoga, holding floor poses for a longer period of time
  (3-5min) to go inward, to connect and stretch the deeper connective tissues.
  After our Yin session we finish with an hour long sound healing session with
  Jodi McLean, who will help you harmonize your mind, body and mind. This mini
  retreat starts at 9am till 1pm @Still, located at 526 San Anselmo Avenue, San
  Anselmo.
details: Wear comfortable clothes and dress in layers.
