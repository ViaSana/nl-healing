  Join me and Ellie Dominquez and Jodi McLean  for a morning of healing
  practices and community around grief. Grief comes in many different forms and
  is something we all deal with in our lives. The purpose this workshop is to
  start the conversation of how grief is unfolding in your life. I hope you will
  leave with a new in-person connection and a true sense that you are not alone
  and feel very supported. We will begin the morning with a light refreshments
  and mingling followed by an essential oil blend workshop to educate and create
  your won blend to support your current life yourney. Then we will break and
  set up for a Yin Yoga class with hands on Reiki, Yin Yoga is a slower and
  meditating form of yoga, holding floor for a longer period of time (3-5min) to
  go inward, to connect and stretch the deeper connective tissues. After our Yin
  session we finish with an hour long sound healing session with Jodi McLean,
  who will help you harmonize your mind, body and mind.
