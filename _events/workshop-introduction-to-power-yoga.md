summary: >-
  This Workshop is for people who want to experience Power Yoga but do not know
  what itâ€™s all about or for people who like to dive deeper in the alignment of
  the Power poses and deepen their practice.  We will break down the poses you
  will commonly find in a Power Class and we go over the modifications and how
  to use the block as a prop.   This workshop is for all levels, even if you
  have no experience at all and never have set a foot in a Power Yoga class. 
  You will leave this workshop with more knowledge about the most common Power
  poses so you can feel more confidence in your practice.
