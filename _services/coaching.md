To (re)find the joy that will activate the flow of your creative energy so you can feel and tap into what really matters to you. I will guide you on how to recognize when you’re out of flow and give you the tools on how you can reconnect and come\_ back to living in flow so you can start creating your most authentic life.\n"

  <p>As an intuitive coach I guide you on how to unlock the flow of your
  creative energy and to (re)connect with your true-self and your heart's
  desire. When we work together my role is to listen to what you say and to the
  energy that’s present. In this process we’re able to identify what may be
  blocking you from living your most authentic life. We start a journey to
  discover what sparks true joy for you by using different tools, like
  meditation, visualization, journaling, Reiki, by feeling and (re)connecting
  with your body through movement or a blend of them.<br /><br />By bringing joy
  back in your life we can light the spark of&nbsp; your creative energy. This
  energy will unlock your desires, wishes and dreams you have for this life.
  Step by step you start to develop the awareness to work with this creative
  energy, to learn how to tap in with your intuition and start trusting your
  inner wisdom. You will be able to recognize when you're out of flow, when you
  have to pause and reconnect with your higher self, tune in with your breath,
  to step back in your body, to feel and to ground yourself and come back to
  what really matters to you right now, in this moment.</p>
