  description: ' In today’s world it’s easy to loose yourself in all the business and noise. Cultural norms, pressures and expectations  are just a few things that can create disconnection from your true essence, your center and your feelings. Stress, anxiety, low self esteem, burn-out and depression can be the results of this disconnect. With the events I offer I want to create a space  where you can slow down, where you can reconnect with your true-self, a space where you can transform and heal.'
