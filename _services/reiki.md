  Reiki is a healing art technique from Japan where one's hands are used to
  channel life-force energy for healing. Reiki helps with reducing stress and
  anxiety and by helping people become more energetically balanced, physically,
  emotionally, mentally and spiritually.
copy_html: >-
  <p>Reiki was developed in the early 1900s in Japan by a man named Mikao Usui.
  The term Reiki comes from the Japanese words “rei” meaning “universal” and
  “ki” which refers to the vital life force energy that flows through all living
  beings and things.<br /><br />Reiki practitioners channel the universal life
  force energy and use their hands to let the Reiki flow where it needs to go in
  your body. The Reiki is always there and always flowing but needs consent to
  be received, step into a Reiki session with an open mind and open heart to
  feel the benefits of a Reiki treatment. Reiki is all about bringing balance
  and harmony, so it can assist with a myriad of symptoms from anxiety, stress,
  overwhelm, physical pain, migraines and overcoming fears. More than anything
  Reiki brings people a deep feeling of peace and a renewed sense of trust for
  their path. Reiki brings awareness how important it is to tune in with
  yourself and with your needs to find your way back home to yourself.</p>

    Reiki permission if I can place my hands on that certain area.
